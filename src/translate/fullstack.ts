              Hi, I am Vladimir and in this video I will tell you about my
              Linux/Unix experience. I have been working in the Linux
              environment for 12 years. I like Linux for its reliability and a
              great opportunity to learn new things every day. I worked in
              different distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Centos and
              so on. One day I even built a Gentoo distro just for learning
              purposes.
            </p>
            <p> 
              I can set up and configure pretty much any kind of software in
              Linux. For scripting sometimes I’m using Shell/Bash sometimes
              Python. I also have experience with Web servers, like Apache and
              Nginx and also Python WSGI. Databases servers such as MySQL,
              MariaDB, PostgreSQL and Elastic search. FTP servers, here are VS
              FTP, ProFTPD. Network related staff (NFC, SAMBA, Bing9, SSH,
              etc.). And security related staff: IP tables, Fail to ban, SSl and
              even more. I also have designed by myself a complex Backup system,
              using Crone, Python and BASH scripting.
              </p>
              <p>During my developer’s
              career, I have been facing a lot of different difficult tasks. For
              example, two years ago our company was needed to solve a problem
              with the VOIP business phone system. And I set up the Asterisk on
              the Slackware distro from scratch, with no prior knowledge. I tell
              you it is not for the faint-hearted at all. I like to get to the
              heart of the matter of things so Linux gives me that opportunity
              almost every day. Thank you. Bye.

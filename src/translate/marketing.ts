              Hi, I’m Vladimir.
              I've been working less or more in online marketing since 2002.
              Marketing knowledge is absolutely needed for a good web developer.
            </p>
            <p> 
              If you intend to earn money from your web project, even before you start designing it you must first build a marketing strategy.

              Marketing strategy affects everything in the web project.
              What technology to use, what framework, what the logic should be.
              How long it takes to deliver the project and how much it will be.

              Finally the business whether it will run well or it will die depends on it.
              So I learned and practiced about marketing a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have build automated advertising system
                Automated sales funnels
                Systems for building semantic cores
                Natural language processing applications
                Analytic system for advertisement efficiency
                Automatic systems for SMM
                etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cose I am good at online marketing my web projects succeed in most cases. 
              performance indicators of one of my latest projects you can find down below.
              Take care bye.
            </p>
